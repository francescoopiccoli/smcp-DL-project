# Group 73: Deep Learning (CS4240) Project
The project aims at training and reproducing the Soft Masking for Cost-Constrained Channel Pruning (SMCP) method, proposed by Humble et al. (2022) in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02206.pdf) Soft Masking for Cost-Constrained Channel Pruning on a ResNet-18 architecture and on the CIFAR10 dataset. Reutilizing the code for the pruning developed by the authors, available at [this](https://github.com/NVlabs/SMCP) Github page.
